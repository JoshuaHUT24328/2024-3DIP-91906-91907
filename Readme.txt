In my program, there are multiple libraries/modules, that must be installed in order for my program to work.
Many of these libraries/modules come with Python, however, some may not, and so will need to be installed manually.
The process of installing libraries can differ depending on things such as platform, but there should be sufficient information available online to help install any libraries that are not pre-installed.
The libraries used in my program are listed below:

- Tkinter
- PIL/Pillow (NOT installed by default)
- datetime
- csv
- json
- ssl
- smtplib
- mime
